## new-web: A Simple HTML, CSS, and JavaScript Project

This repository contains the code for a basic web page built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 

**What's Included:**

* `index.html`: The main HTML file for the web page.
* `style.css`: Styles applied to the web page.
* `script.js`: JavaScript code to enhance the web page's functionality (optional, depending on your implementation).

**How to Use:**

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   Open your terminal and navigate to your desired directory. 

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Solomon-the-octave/new-web.git
   ```

2. **Run the Project:**

   There are two ways to run the project:

      * **Local Server:**

         Navigate to the project directory:

         ```bash
         cd new-web
         ```

         Start a local server using a tool like Live Server or Python's `http.server`. Refer to the documentation of your chosen tool for specific instructions.

         Once the server is running, open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:<port>`, where `<port>` is the port assigned by your local server (usually 5500 or 8000).

      * **Open in Browser (Directly):**

         You can open `index.html` directly in your web browser, but some interactive features using JavaScript might not work as expected.

**Further Development:**

This is a basic project template. Feel free to modify the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files to create your own unique web page.
